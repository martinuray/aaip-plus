## Content
This course teaches the practical application of various tools and techniques
for data analysis and machine learning.
The focus here is on the application on various, real world datasets.


We focus on three aspects during this course:

1. Introduction to Python including extensive programming exercises
2. Data Visualization and Analysis
3. Hands-On Machine Learning

## Attendance

This course has mandatory attendance in ALL classes. You may miss only $4$ classes.
