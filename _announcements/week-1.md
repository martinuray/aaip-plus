After consulting with the administration, we regret to inform you that we are 
unable to increase the number of participants for the _Applied AI with Python_ 
course. 

Initially, 66 students registered, but we are only equipped to accommodate 
around 30 students. Currently, we have accepted over 40 students, which is the 
absolute limit of our capacity in terms of both room space and supervision.

Should any students drop out during the designated drop-out period, we will 
offer spots to those on the waiting list. 
In this case, students will be notified via email.

In case not attending this course hinder your study progress, I kindly advise 
you to contact the study program director to discuss alternative solutions.
Unfortunately, I am not able to offer any additional spots in this course.

I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your understanding.
